# Project Proposal:
Project title:
Reading List Recommendations

What and Why:
Website automatically consolidating book and movie recommendations from famous individuals. Users would get recommendations on great media to consume.
As for why, there is a vast amount of knowledge out there siloed in different resources/media. Often it can be hard to discern which great book or podcast should be next on our lists. This project hopes to reduce that issue through providing recommendations from experts and influencers to help narrow the decision.


For Whom?:
For anyone interested in finding new pieces of media to consumer (podcast listeners, book readers, TV show watchers, etc.)

How?:
Users can look for media under a topic or look for individuals to understand what media they have recommended. I.e. a user could look up "Product Management Books" and be provided with a list of the best PM books recommended by experts.

Scope:
Webapp Interface
Database on the backend
